					<h1>SPI Initiative</h1>
					<p>
						Software development is the lifeblood here at HealthCare Solutions. As a company with over 100 employees developing state of the art IT systems which are being used right across the health care sector in Ireland, it is vital that our products are defect free and any existing defects are tracked and dealt with promptly. At the present moment this company lacks a well  defined, uniform process for handling defects. As the software quality assonance officer, I propose that we embark on a software process improvement initiative which will see the implementation of <b>Formal Technical Reviews</b>. The aims of implementing this initiative is to develop an effective system for <b>Defect Elimination</b>
					</P>
				</div>
				
				<div class="s1-2">
					<h2>Defects</h2>
					<p>
						Part of this SPI initiative is to detect and eliminate defects found within our software. Defect elimination is where we focuses on preventing defects from emerging within a system, and if they do make their into a system then we have procedures in place for detecting and removing them from the system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order for us to prevent defects from appearing within a system we will need to ensure that our developers are at an adequate level of competence and experience within their chosen field of expertise.  Having the right software processes like agile or extreme development in place will also help us to prevent defects in our products. Furthermore the management and product leads will also need to pay their part in ensuring that project requirements, targets, and deadlines are clear and feasible.
					</p>
					<p>
						When defects get into a system, and it&#146;s only a question of when and how many, we must ensure that we have sufficient detection and removal process in place. Examples of detecting defects in software is to have walkthroughs, formal reviews and inspections. In order to ensure that such defects are removed we must continuously test and debug our software.
					
					</p>
					<p>
						There are several reasons as to why we should. Having an idea what type of bugs and how much time we should be putting into detecting and removing them will determine not only the progress being made on a project, but also the quality of the software, and development of best practices that will increase process performance and capabilities of the software products. Furthermore analysing defects will allow us to better differentiate on whether a defect is minor or major.  It is however important that we keep in mind that most techniques used in planning rely on historical data.
				</div>
				<div class="s1-3">
					<h2>Technical Reviews</h2>
					<p>
						Reviews have been shown to be more effective than testing in ensuring that programs are error-free. They can also, be used on products which cannot be tested, such as specifications, designs, documentation, text plan,etc.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is a widely held belief that inspections are far more effective at discovering defects in a product, and that products that are inspected tend to have far fewer defects. According to Falon, 67% of all defects are found upon inspection, and the number of faults found 7 months after product release are around 38% fewer.	
					</p>
					<p>
						By detecting and correcting defects early, it can help to substantially reduce HealthCare Solutions&#146;s cost of subsequent steps in the development and maintenance phases.
					</p>
						<h4>Undertaking this initiative we need to be aware of the core concepts which underpin reviews.</h4>
					<ul class="list-balance">
						<li>Keep in mind the objectives to these reviews.</li>
						<li>These reviews are to find specific kinds of errors.</li>
						<li>They are to verify that the software meets the requirements.</li>
						<li>The software conforms to the standards set down by healthCare Solutions.</li>
						<li>To sign off on a fully completed stage in the development of a project.</li>
						<li>To produce more maintainable software.</li>	
						<li>Reviews are not meant to correct the work product, or to accuse the developer of incompetence or failure. These reviews must be objective in nature.,</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="s1-4">
					<h2>How Reviews Work</h2>
					<p>
						Generic technical reviews can be broken down into three distinct methods. Each has method has associated goals and typical attributes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, walkthroughs are used to achieve a low cost way in getting either new developers up to speed on a project or to quickly change the direction of the project. Walkthroughs also, have a tendency to be very informal, unmeasurable and have very little preparation work behind them. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Formal technical reviews, on the other hand, are used for developing requirements for a project as well as trying remove any existing ambiguity already present in the requirements. Furthermore these technical reviews can be used to provide a more structured way of training staff on a project. Given the name of this method, these reviews follow a more formal  process, with a more developed presentation, as well as providing a platform for a wide range discussions relating to the the review.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final method is inspections. Inspections are a visual examination of a software product to detect and identify software anomalies, which range from errors to deviations from the standards and specifications set down by this firm.

					<h1>Improvements to our Software</h1>
					<p>
						Implementing Formal Technical Reviews will greatly improve the quality of the software that is being developed here at HealthCare Solutions. By implementing reviews in throughout our development process, it will yield several key benefits that will improve how we develop our software.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s2-2">
					<h2>Project Development</h2>
					<p>
						The first benefit is that reviews will help improve the scheduling performance, as the various methods of review will uncover defects. They&#146;ll also reduce the amount of rework, which typically accounts for 44% of the development cost. 
					</p>
					<p>

						These reviews will help uncover 60-100% of defects within a project. Not only will we be able to put into production software that simple works and on schedule, but, over time the costs  and time associated with maintaining that software will be much more economical. This is because the earlier that defects are detected, the cheaper they are to remove. And this could be 10-100 times cheaper. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Reviews are the most proactive form of tests, in that they uncover defects that would not otherwise be picked up by tests.
					</p>
					<p>
						By conducting a formal technical review of a project or product the author of that review will be able collect information about defects that exist within the project. Simply having  the author know about the defects within a project will allow testers and other developers to be able to categorise the defects and remove them as needed. Furthermore a  technical review will help collect all the information about the project, its purpose and progress, and allow interested parties, like management, get a better feel for the project.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s2-3">
					<h2>Developers</h2>
					<p>
						By having developers review each others code, this can have an impact on morale. This impact can be either negative or positive. Therefore it is important that developers view reviews as an opportunity to gain visibility and recognition of their work as opposed to an intrusion of their workplace. Essentially we hope to create a situation where by the developers communicate more often with each other. The benefit here, is that we can develop a team mentality within the developers. Which will improve morale, work satisfaction and collaboration.
					</p>
					<p>
						From a technical point of view, since developers are required to view each other&#146;s code it can force developers to present their code in a standard format i.e. indention, clear variable names, etc. This will make the maintainability of the code much easier, even if it is a different developer who has to work with the code down the line.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore reviews will have an impact on maintainability of software. The very nature of a review process requires the technical aspects of the project to be scrutinised and therefore needs to be understandable for the inspectors. For the software to be understandable, there needs to be well  documented. The key benefit here is that developers will need to incrementally add documentation that is necessary for a review, which might not otherwise have been created. The review process will also help the developers general understanding of how the system  operates. While documentation doesn&#146;t necessarily translate to an easy to maintain software, it does at least contribute to it. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s2-4">
					<h2>Developer Training</h2>
					<p>
						Reviews can provide ample educational benefits. Having reviews will lead to a better understanding of the software by review participants that can be obtained by reading the documentation as well as the opportunity of acquiring additional technical skills by observing the works of others. As a result reviews can serve as an excellent training ground for junior developers to observe different approaches to software analysis, design, and implementation. Furthermore formal technical reviews  can help promote backup and continuity because a number of people become familiar with parts of the software that they may not have otherwise seen.

					<h1>Improvements to our Organisation</h1>
					<p>
						Implementing Formal Technical Reviews will greatly improve the quality of the software that is being developed here at HealthCare Solutions. By implementing reviews in throughout our development process, it will yield several key benefits that will improve how we develop our software.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the benefits that formal technical reviews have is that they provide quantifiable data about the progress of projects. For example the amount of time spent on each phase, and the number of defects of each type discovered. Reviews can also help produce qualitative data,like, the usefulness of the review meetings, and verifying if the requirements are are still in scope with the software being created. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore formal technical reviews can help improve the organisation by providing analysis over time. By continuously conducting reviews we should expect, new and better checklist items, improvements in the way reviews themselves are being conducted, better software development processes, and better standards to which the software can be held up to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Software development is complex and error-prone by nature, both in the development and maintenance of software. As a result defects will inevitably make  their way into the final product over time and the longer that time is, the more frequent defects emerge and the higher cost to remove them. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Reviews will offer HealthCare Solutions greater flexibility over projects. This is because, reviews will allow the identification of deliverables with well defined entry and exit criteria and successful review of these deliverables will reveal the progress being made on a project that can be followed and managed more easily. This tracking will be beneficial for both in house project management, but also for our customers.

					<h1>Implementation</h1>
					<p>
						There are many variations to perform technical reviews. The vast majority of these approaches involve a group meeting to asses the project. However, some variations do not require a review group meeting. The variation that I&#146;ll looking to implement is the Round Robin Review in which a developers work is circulated among reviewers in a round robin fashion for their comments. The variation assigns developers into particular roles.This logic is the same other initiatives that improve software quality, like agile development ,use. In technical reviews we will have a moderator, inspectors, an author, a reader, and a recorder.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s4-2">
					<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p>
						Inspectors, are the examiners of the software under review. They ought to be our more experienced and trained developers. Inspectors will aim to uncover defects and ensure that the software satisfies the requirements and meets the standards that HealthCare Solutions abide by. Inspectors take on more specialised roles like moderators and readers. 
					</p>
					<p>
						A moderator acts as the manager of the review will take up responsibilities such as scheduling meetings , ensures that everyone has the proper materials, chairs meetings, reports inspection results, and monitors follow-up activities.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reader is another inspector who reads each line of code the author has written.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recorders take notes during the review meetings; they should not be confused with moderator who effectively leads the review process.
					</p>
					<p>
						The author is the developer who has created the software that is being put under review.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s4-3">
					<h2>
						Walkthroughs
					</h2>
					<p>
						The first step in the technical review process is the walkthrough. Walkthroughs can be viewed as presentation reviews  in which a review participant, usually the author, narrates a description of the software and the remainder of the review group provides their feedback throughout the presentation. These are referred to as presentation reviews because the bulk of the feedback usually occurs for the material actually presented at the level it is presented. A limitation of these walkthroughs is that reviewers will find it hard to prepare for them, and as a result, walkthroughs may lead to disorganised and uncontrolled reviews. We must also bear in mind  that walkthroughs may be very stressful for the author of the software and it may help to assign the reader to present the work instead.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next step are the inspections. Inspections should be viewed as the formal part of the review process. They require a high degree of preparation for the inspectors and author, but the benefits include a more systematic review of the software and a more controlled and less stressed meeting.   These meetings should be approximately 2 hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many variations of inspections, but they all involve checklists. Checklists serve as a way to ensure that work under review pass or satisfy a set of constraints, which can be work practices and standards. Inspections are also associated with rigorous entry and exit requirements for the work being inspected.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inspections are different from walkthroughs in that an inspection process involves the collection of data that can be used to feedback on the quality of the development and review process. This data can also be used to influence future validation techniques on the software itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						The last step is the audit. Audits should also be describes as an external type of review process. They ensure that the software is properly validated and that the process is producing its intended results.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are several tools we can use to help us set up this system of formal technical review, like <a href="www.klocwork.com/">Klockwork</a>. Such technologies offer us a framework in which to set up the above processes.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s4-4">
					<h2>Work Practices</h2>
					<p>
						Implementing the formal technical reviews there are several best practices that we should aim to implement for the most efficient, lightweight perched review that have been proven to be effective by scientific study and by SmartBear&#146;s extensive field experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						Review fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time. According to Cisco&#146;s code review study, code reviews are most effective when the inspector reviews fewer than 200-400 lines of code at a time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Aim for an inspection rate of less than 300-500 lines of code per hour. According to SmartBear&#146;s study&#146;s on code review, faster is not better. This due to fact that if the inspector is overwhelmed by a large quantity of code, they won&#146;t give the same attention to every line as they might with a small change.
					</p>
					<p>
						You should not however spend more than 90 minutes reviewing in one sitting. This means the inspector shouldn&#146;t spend too long reviewing code in one sitting, despite the fact the we earlier said that the inspector shouldn&#146;t review too quickly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Have the author of the low level documentation prepare their work prior to review. If the author takes responsibility to double check their work prior to review they may correct defects on a second glance. This would mean that the inspector will encounter fewer defects, if any at all.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is vitally important that we establish quantifiable goals and capture metrics so that we can tailor the review process to suit us.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having checklists can substantially improve the results for both authors and inspector.  By making use of checklists we can easily detect the hardest defect of all, omissions. Encouraging authors to develop their own personal checklist can help improve the quality of the software they generate before it is even put forward for review.
					</p>
					<p>
						A good practice to have is to verify that defects are actually fixed. A scenario that can easily emerge in Healthcare Solutions is that the inspectors uncover the defects but lack the proper tools to be able to track defects that  have been uncovered. There are a wide range of tools that can be used to keep track of defects, like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In terms of culture, we must foster an environment within code reviews where finding defects is viewed positively. Managers must promote the viewpoint that defectives are positive. After all, for every defect removed the better the software project is upon release.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taking on these review practices it is very important that we continuously asses their effectiveness.  One informal way method of assessing the effectiveness of review processes is to observe their impact on the testing process. Some studies report that effective reviews reduce the total test time and production failures. Whereas others have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of reviews using statistical techniques.
