					<h1>SPI Initiative</h1>
					<p>
						Software development is the lifeblood here at HealthCare Solutions. As a company with over 100 employees developing state of the art IT systems which are being used right across the health care sector in Ireland, it is vital that our products are defect free and any existing defects are tracked and dealt with promptly. At the present moment this company lacks a well  defined, uniform process for handling defects. As the software quality assonance officer, I propose that we embark on a software process improvement initiative which will see the implementation of <b>Formal Technical Reviews</b>. The aims of implementing this initiative is to develop an effective system for <b>Defect Elimination</b>
					</P>
				</div>
				
				<div class="s1-2">
					<h2>Defects</h2>
					<p>
						Part of this SPI initiative is to detect and eliminate defects found within our software. Defect elimination is where we focuses on preventing defects from emerging within a system, and if they do make their into a system then we have procedures in place for detecting and removing them from the system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order for us to prevent defects from appearing within a system we will need to ensure that our developers are at an adequate level of competence and experience within their chosen field of expertise.  Having the right software processes like agile or extreme development in place will also help us to prevent defects in our products. Furthermore the management and product leads will also need to pay their part in ensuring that project requirements, targets, and deadlines are clear and feasible.
					</p>
					<p>
						When defects get into a system, and it&#146;s only a question of when and how many, we must ensure that we have sufficient detection and removal process in place. Examples of detecting defects in software is to have walkthroughs, formal reviews and inspections. In order to ensure that such defects are removed we must continuously test and debug our software.
					
					</p>
					<p>
						There are several reasons as to why we should. Having an idea what type of bugs and how much time we should be putting into detecting and removing them will determine not only the progress being made on a project, but also the quality of the software, and development of best practices that will increase process performance and capabilities of the software products. Furthermore analysing defects will allow us to better differentiate on whether a defect is minor or major.  It is however important that we keep in mind that most techniques used in planning rely on historical data.
				</div>
				<div class="s1-3">
					<h2>Technical Reviews</h2>
					<p>
						Reviews have been shown to be more effective than testing in ensuring that programs are error-free. They can also, be used on products which cannot be tested, such as specifications, designs, documentation, text plan,etc.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is a widely held belief that inspections are far more effective at discovering defects in a product, and that products that are inspected tend to have far fewer defects. According to Falon, 67% of all defects are found upon inspection, and the number of faults found 7 months after product release are around 38% fewer.	
					</p>
					<p>
						By detecting and correcting defects early, it can help to substantially reduce HealthCare Solutions&#146;s cost of subsequent steps in the development and maintenance phases.
					</p>
						<h4>Undertaking this initiative we need to be aware of the core concepts which underpin reviews.</h4>
					<ul class="list-balance">
						<li>Keep in mind the objectives to these reviews.</li>
						<li>These reviews are to find specific kinds of errors.</li>
						<li>They are to verify that the software meets the requirements.</li>
						<li>The software conforms to the standards set down by healthCare Solutions.</li>
						<li>To sign off on a fully completed stage in the development of a project.</li>
						<li>To produce more maintainable software.</li>	
						<li>Reviews are not meant to correct the work product, or to accuse the developer of incompetence or failure. These reviews must be objective in nature.,</li>

					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="s1-4">
					<h2>How Reviews Work</h2>
					<p>
						Generic technical reviews can be broken down into three distinct methods. Each has method has associated goals and typical attributes. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, walkthroughs are used to achieve a low cost way in getting either new developers up to speed on a project or to quickly change the direction of the project. Walkthroughs also, have a tendency to be very informal, unmeasurable and have very little preparation work behind them. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Formal technical reviews, on the other hand, are used for developing requirements for a project as well as trying remove any existing ambiguity already present in the requirements. Furthermore these technical reviews can be used to provide a more structured way of training staff on a project. Given the name of this method, these reviews follow a more formal  process, with a more developed presentation, as well as providing a platform for a wide range discussions relating to the the review.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final method is inspections. Inspections are a visual examination of a software product to detect and identify software anomalies, which range from errors to deviations from the standards and specifications set down by this firm.

					<h1>Improvements to our Software</h1>
					<p>
						Implementing Formal Technical Reviews will greatly improve the quality of the software that is being developed here at HealthCare Solutions. By implementing reviews in throughout our development process, it will yield several key benefits that will improve how we develop our software.
					</p>
					<h2>Project Development</h2>
					<p>
						The first benefit is that reviews will help improve the scheduling performance, as the various methods of review will uncover defects. They&#146;ll also reduce the amount of rework, which typically accounts for 44% of the development cost. 
					</p>
					<p>

						These reviews will help uncover 60-100% of defects within a project. Not only will we be able to put into production software that simple works and on schedule, but, over time the costs  and time associated with maintaining that software will be much more economical. This is because the earlier that defects are detected, the cheaper they are to remove. And this could be 10-100 times cheaper. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Reviews are the most proactive form of tests, in that they uncover defects that would not otherwise be picked up by tests.
					</p>
					<p>
						By conducting a formal technical review of a project or product the author of that review will be able collect information about defects that exist within the project. Simply having  the author know about the defects within a project will allow testers and other developers to be able to categorise the defects and remove them as needed. Furthermore a  technical review will help collect all the information about the project, its purpose and progress, and allow interested parties, like management, get a better feel for the project.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s2-2">
					<h2>Developers</h2>
					<p>
						By having developers review each others code, this can have an impact on morale. This impact can be either negative or positive. Therefore it is important that developers view reviews as an opportunity to gain visibility and recognition of their work as opposed to an intrusion of their workplace. Essentially we hope to create a situation where by the developers communicate more often with each other. The benefit here, is that we can develop a team mentality within the developers. Which will improve morale, work satisfaction and collaboration.
					</p>
					<p>
						From a technical point of view, since developers are required to view each other&#146;s code it can force developers to present their code in a standard format i.e. indention, clear variable names, etc. This will make the maintainability of the code much easier, even if it is a different developer who has to work with the code down the line.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore reviews will have an impact on maintainability of software. The very nature of a review process requires the technical aspects of the project to be scrutinised and therefore needs to be understandable for the inspectors. For the software to be understandable, there needs to be well  documented. The key benefit here is that developers will need to incrementally add documentation that is necessary for a review, which might not otherwise have been created. The review process will also help the developers general understanding of how the system  operates. While documentation doesn&#146;t necessarily translate to an easy to maintain software, it does at least contribute to it. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="s2-3">
					<h2>Developer Training</h2>
					<p>
						Reviews can provide ample educational benefits. Having reviews will lead to a better understanding of the software by review participants that can be obtained by reading the documentation as well as the opportunity of acquiring additional technical skills by observing the works of others. As a result reviews can serve as an excellent training ground for junior developers to observe different approaches to software analysis, design, and implementation. Furthermore formal technical reviews  can help promote backup and continuity because a number of people become familiar with parts of the software that they may not have otherwise seen.
